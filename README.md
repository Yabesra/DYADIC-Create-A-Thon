## Project Details
### Summary of who we are & our model

We have created a wildfire risk assessment model using weather data to predict the risk of a wildfires in California. This gives all home owners, property owners, businesses, and firefighters time to both prepare and respond in the case of a real fire. Nothing like this technology is currently on the market, as many apps that exist alert people after a fire has already started. We work to alert people before a fire happens, and we hope that our implementation of this model can help save many lives.

### Future Plans: More to Come 
* More user research
* Add more fires to our dataset
* Add more information about each fire
* Satellite heat maps to track fires
* Expand our model to other states and countries
* Add more features to the user interface
* Track risk and impact of smoke
