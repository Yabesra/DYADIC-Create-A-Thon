# Summry of who we are

We have created a wildfire risk assessment model using weather data to predict the risk of a wildfire. This gives all home owners, property owners, businesses, and firefighters time to both prepare and respond in the case of a real fire. Nothin like this technology is on the market. Through our market research we have found that many apps work on alerting people after it's happened we work to alert people before it happens. Hopefully using this model we can help save many lives.

### Future Plans: More to Come 
* More user research
* Add more fires to our dataset
* Add more information about each fire
* Satellite heat maps to track fires
* Expand our model to other states and countries
* Add more features to the user interface
* Track risk of smoke
